# Machine Learning based Prediction of COVID-19 diagnosis based on symptoms

- Utilized Na√Øve Bayes, Support Vector Machine, K-Nearest Neighbors, Extreme Gradient Boosting, Random Forest Classifier, and Logistic Regression algorithms to make predictions about patient diagnoses (positive or negative) using Python in Google Collaboratory.

- Applied preprocessing techniques to clean and enhance recorded data samples using libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, scikit-learn, and SMOTE. Employed Feature Selection methods to achieve an accuracy of over 85% with the help of SciPy and seaborn libraries.

- Evaluated the efficiency of the Machine Learning algorithms employed through Performance Metrics and visualized their results using AUC-ROC curve with the assistance of Matplotlib, Seaborn, and roccurve libraries.
