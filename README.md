# Machine Learning based Prediction of COVID-19 diagnosis based on symptoms

- Utilized Na√Øve Bayes, SVM, k-NN Extreme Gradient Boosting, Random Forest Classifier, and Logistic Regression to make predictions
   about patient diagnosis (positive or negative) using Python in Google Collaboratory.
- Implemented SVM, LR, k-NN, DTC and RFC Machine Learning algorithms and developed RMI Scoring System to process the Ovarian
   Cancer tumor dataset to categorize cases as benign, malignant, and borderline, and used Python in Google Collaboratory and Jupyter
   Notebook to predict the accuracy of the models.
- Applied preprocessing techniques to clean and enhance recorded data samples using libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, scikit-learn, and
   SMOTE. Employed Feature Selection methods to achieve an accuracy of over 85% with the help of SciPy and seaborn libraries.
- Evaluated the efficiency of the algorithms employed through Performance Metrics and visualized their results using AUC-ROC curve with 
   the  assistance of Matplotlib, Seaborn, and roccurve libraries.
